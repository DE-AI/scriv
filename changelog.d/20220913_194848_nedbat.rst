Changed
.......

- The ``github_release`` command now only considers the top-most entry in the
  changelog.  You can use the ``--all`` option to continue the old behavior of
  making or updating GitHub releases for all of the entries.

  This change makes it easier for projects to start using scriv with an
  existing populated changelog file.

  Closes `issue 57`_.
